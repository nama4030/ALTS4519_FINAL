Game Name: The Floor is Lava
By: Zheng Tang & Napass (Ben) Masathienvong

'The Floor is Lava' is a immersive VR game that is designed for players to challenge their skills to navigate through 5 unique parkour levels. The player interaction includes the use of a Google Card Board to look around, a joystick to move around, and a trigger button to jump within the game. The levels are designed so that the difficulty increases, by adding moving platforms and smaller paths for the player to walk. The game also has a check point saver so that they can respawn at the most current level they are on.
